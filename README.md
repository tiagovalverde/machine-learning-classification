### Logistic Regression
- Ideal for 2 class problems
- Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)
	- mapping any ranges down to [0,1]

### The problem setting
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#introduction

#### Supervised Learning
additional attributes (class) present that we want to predict

##### Classification
- samples belong to 2 or more classes
- learn from already labeled data to predict unlabeled data

##### Regression
- Output consists of one or more continuous variables (Iris, House Pricing)

#### Unsupeervised Learning
- set of input vectors x withouth corresponding target values.
- Goal is 
	- to discover groups within the data (Clustering)
	- determine the distribution of data within the input space (Density Estimation)
	- project data in high dimensional space
